# dog-trick-game
My first project in Unity! 

You are a dog (Django) and have to copy the leader dog(?)'s moves in time with the beats, three at a time.

If you mess up a move, you lose a life, but if you win the round, you can choose between more life or a cupcake.

Collect 10 cupcakes to win.

Target platform is phones.

Intended to be a birthday present for my sister's 30th birthday ^____^

Woof.
